This is the first project of my spring 2026 semester in game production. The project was to make a simple mini game in the bitsy game maker (bitsy.org) 



From v1.0 to v2.0:

The audio was corrected, ensuring music plays in every room
More rooms were added to increase game length
Walls were added to prevent player wandering, and limit confusion
Game/story context was added through dialogue
